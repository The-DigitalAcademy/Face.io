## General Info
Face.io is a project that uses facial recognition technology to capture employee faces as they enter the building. The system then records the employee's name, surname and employee number, which can be used for attendance tracking and security purposes. The system can also convert the captured data into a CSV file, which makes it easy to process and analyze the data. This type of technology can help streamline the check-in process for employees, improve security measures and provide valuable insights into emnployee attendance patterns

## Technologies used
- Python
- PowerBi
- API or Web Application
- SQL

## Features
1.Facial recognition: The system should be able to accurately recognize the employees' faces as they enter the designated area.
2.Attendance tracking: The system should be able to record the date, time, and duration of each employee's visit, and maintain an accurate attendance record.
3.Employee identification: The system should be able to identify each employee by name and employee number, and associate this information with their facial image.
4.Reporting and analytics: The system should be able to generate reports and analytics on employee attendance patterns, such as average time spent in the designated area, absenteeism rates, and other key metrics.
5.Security and privacy: The system should be designed with security and privacy in mind, including encryption of employee data, access controls, and compliance with relevant privacy regulations.
6.Scalability and integration: The system should be scalable and able to integrate with other software applications or hardware devices, such as HR systems, access control systems, or building management systems.

## Setup
1.Hardware setup: A high resolution CCTV in a well-lit area around the building will be used to capture employees' faces as they enter. Multiple cameras may be used.

2.Software setup: Install facial recognition software on a local server or cloud-based platform. The software should be configured to recognize the employees' faces and associate them with their name and employee number.

3.Database setup: Set up a database to store the captured employee data, including their facial image, name, employee number, and attendance records. Depending on the number of employees and volume of data, a SQL database may be appropriate.

4.Capturing App: The app should be used to register new employees or cohort so that the system recognizes them

5.Testing and validation: Before deploying the system, perform rigorous testing to ensure that it accurately recognizes employees' faces and records their attendance data correctly.

6.Deployment: Once the system is fully tested and validated, it can be deployed in the designated area. Ensure that appropriate training is provided to employees and that the system is adequately maintained and updated as needed.


## Usage
1.Employee check-in: As employees enter the designated area, they would approach the camera and have their face captured by the system.

2.Face recognition: The system would analyze the facial image and compare it to the database of employee images to identify the employee by name and employee number.

3.Attendance tracking: Once the employee is identified, the system would record their check-in time and update their attendance record. If the employee leaves the designated area and returns later, the system would also record their check-out time and duration of absence.

4.Reporting and analysis: The system would generate reports and analytics on employee attendance patterns, such as average time spent in the designated area, absenteeism rates, and other key metrics.

5.Integration with other systems: If the system is integrated with other software applications, such as HR systems or access control systems, the attendance data would be automatically shared with those systems.
